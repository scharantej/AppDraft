 ## Flask Application Design for Email Draft Generation

### HTML Files

**1. index.html**
- This is the main HTML file that will serve as the user interface for generating the email draft.
- It should include a form with fields for the recipient's email address, subject, and body of the email.
- The form should also have a submit button that triggers the Flask route to generate the email draft.

**2. draft.html**
- This HTML file will display the generated email draft to the user.
- It should include the recipient's email address, subject, and body of the email, as well as a button to send the email.

### Routes

**1. /generate_draft**
- This route will be triggered when the user clicks the submit button on the index.html page.
- It will receive the form data (recipient's email address, subject, and body of the email) and use it to generate an email draft.
- The generated draft should be saved to a temporary location (e.g., in-memory or a temporary file) and the user should be redirected to the draft.html page.

**2. /send_email**
- This route will be triggered when the user clicks the send button on the draft.html page.
- It will retrieve the generated email draft from the temporary location and send it to the recipient's email address using an appropriate Python library (e.g., smtplib).
- Once the email is sent, the user should be redirected to a success page or provided with a confirmation message.

### Additional Considerations

- The application should include appropriate error handling to gracefully handle any exceptions or errors that may occur during the email generation or sending process.
- The application should follow good security practices, such as sanitizing user input to prevent malicious attacks.
- The application should be designed to be responsive and work well on different devices and screen sizes.
